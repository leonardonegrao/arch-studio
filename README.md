# About

Arch Studio is a website developed for a ficticious architecture agency. The concept and design are from Frontend Mentor, but all the development was planned and done by myself.

The purpose of the project was not only to train skills and the use of the used stack, but to define a blueprint for future projects, because of this, it carries a lot of concepts, technologies and a complete Wiki with instructions and overviews.

For more, check the available [Wiki](https://github.com/leonardonegrao/arch-studio/wiki) of the project (available in brazilian portuguese and english).

A live version is available [here](https://arch-studio-blush.vercel.app/), thanks to Vercel.
